# Chess Implementation Dump
The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space to practice new or rusty code techniques within a fairly well-defined problem space - in this case chess.

Feel free to create your own project subfolder in whatever language or technology stack you prefer.

Pushing directly to master has been disabled - always create a branch and merge via pull request - preferably via Pull Request.
